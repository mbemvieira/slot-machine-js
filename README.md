# slot-machine-js

Make sure you have a newer version of NPM installed before proceding. For this project, I used pure ES6 and [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css) library for some basic styles.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
